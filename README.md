# MySecret  
MySecret is a secure note manager.<br>
It allows you to safe your notes with password, encryption and encoding.
MySecret uses tree layers of security:
- AES-256 Encryption
- Base64 Encoding
- SHA-256 Hashing

## Requirements
- Ruby
- Gem (this usually comes with Ruby)
- Secrets (You want to save something into your notes, right?)

## Usage/Examples
MySecret's main menu looks like this, you can **create a new encrypted note**, **read an encrypted note**, **edit an encrypted note**, **delete a note** **encrypt a raw file**, **decrypt a encrypted file**, **change file password** or **exit**.
```bash
$ ruby ~/MySecret/main.rb

notes: 0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 
========== MySecret ==========
[1] Create new note
[2] Read a note
[3] Edit a note
[4] Delete a note
[5] Encrypt a note
[6] Decrypt a note
[7] Change secret key
[8] Change text editor
[0] Exit
> | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 0 |
```
After that, it will ask you for a **secret key**, which is a file **password**. (MySecret will hash this password using **SHA-256**)<br>
If it's your first time running **MySecret** you need to select a text editor to write down your file, select one of the options, and your text editor will magically open and you can **write all your notes safelly**.
Your default editor will be saved at a configuration file located at _home/.config/MySecret_, you can delete it to reset your preference and choose another. ```configuration file: editor.config```
```bash
file name: MySecret
$ secret key: MyPassword
=================================
Select your favorite text editor:
[0] Nano
[1] VI
[2] VIM
[3] NeoVim
[4] Emacs
[5] Notepad
> | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
```
After saving and exiting from your file, your note will be automatically encoded and encrypted, and **you can access it from the MySecret's menu to decrypt and read it.**
